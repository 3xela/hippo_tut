- teaching myself gpu programming. using claude 4 to help me out. coded on my 7800 XT. i dont have cuda.
- basic gpu kernels for building LLM's are implemented,
- transformer structs implemented
- basic Tensor functinoality
- TODO/IPR: backwards kernels, keeping track of gradients, gradient computation

- maybe gonna get done at some point: linting / formatter
